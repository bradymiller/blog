Dr. Adamo and his group of 18 were using Amazing Charts and wanted to migrate to
an "anywhere access" electronic medical records system.

Below is the list of what Trincay wwas looking for when considering a new
system:

* A cloud-based EMR system
* An ICD-10 based system (Amazing Charts software used ICD-9, however, all
  Cayman Island insurers were soon moving to ICD-10)
* An integrated billing system, compatible with the insurance providers that
  Trincay works with
* Electronic prescriptions
* An ability to migrate Amazing Charts patients
* Assistance with general configuration, particularly for doctors
  charts/personalized consultation sheets and billing
* Integration of current CPT codes and customary fees provided for Cayman
  Islands (Excel files)
* Although not required, HIPAA compliance

With the help of [Open Med Practice](http://www.openmedpractice.com/ns/),
Trincay Medical Center's needs were met by deploying OpenEMR in a secure cloud
environment along with a migrated patient list of over 20,000 patients.
