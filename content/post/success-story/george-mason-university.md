While the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid help many US citizens,
there are still certain gaps with access to care. Luckily, charitable "Safety
Net" clinics can be found all around the country. One such clinic was recently
deployed by the George Mason University, with the help of [Open Med
Practice](http://www.openmedpractice.com/ns/).

Joyce, an essential project member, notes "The clinic will be able to capture
and control patient data for improved clinical decisions and future research". 

Outside of the implementation, Joyce describes the usage of OpenEMR in the
classroom "It allowed me to demonstrate the flexibility, reliability, and
usefulness of open-source systems to faculty and students at George Mason
University. Due to OpenEMR's ease of use, we will also use it as a platform to
train nursing students in our Sim Lab and for our Health Administration & Policy
students to practice data management and health informatics".
