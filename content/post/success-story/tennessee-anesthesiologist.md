A specialty, sole practitioner clinic in Tennessee has recently deployed OpenEMR
to meet his needs. When asked about the strong points of the system, this
practitioner pointed to the adaptability and customizability of OpenEMR.
Moreover, he notes that OpenEMR allows him to "quickly adapt to aggressive
changes in government and insurance company policies". 

With the help of [Open Med Practice](http://www.openmedpractice.com/ns/), this
clinic has been able to adapt to national and local changes in regulations to
stay competitive.
