This Chicago-based organization has successfully deployed OpenEMR to a handful
of their care centers. With high-tech medical equipment and dozens of passionate
and knowledgeable medical professionals, this organization offers patients an
integrated approach to their overall care. The centers boast an impressive
amount of medical services such as family medicine, plastic surgery, spine and
joint physical therapy, preventative and family dentistry, and sleep therapy. 

Leveraging the expertise of Open Med Practice, each of these data-intensive
facilities are running the latest OpenEMR v5 software with customizations to
meet their specific workflows, all in the name of patient outcomes.
