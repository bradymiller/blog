A 60-bed clinic, Ados, Puerto Madryn, with 100 users and 10,000 patients so far,
has successfully deployed OpenEMR on a capable Windows server. 

[Netic Infoservices](http://openemr.com.ar/) installed OpenEMR with
Spanish-translated documentation and terminology as well as diagnostic codes
adapted to the Spanish International Code for Diseases. Outside of the
translation work, this installation included a large data import of health
insurance entities from the Argentine health system, custom administrative
reports to track uninsured patients, and Gynecology forms based on specific
provider requirements. 

The providers are slowly adopting the system, with help of a few committed users
and remote support from Netic Infoservices.
