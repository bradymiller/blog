The Neurology IT department of a top Ivy League Academic Medical Center was
challenged with the task of providing Continuous EEG monitoring of patients for
their physicians. This solution would also need to integrate with existing
medical systems. Dissatisfied with the available off the shelf product
offerings, the department noted that a customizable solution was necessary to
meet the requirements of the physicians and faculty. 

With the help of [ViSolve](http://hc.visolve.com/), the department deployed a
customized OpenEMR solution to provide Continuous EEG monitoring functionality
and systems integration. 

The open source nature of OpenEMR enables and encourages customizations to meet
the specific needs of healthcare providers internationally. Users can deploy and
customize OpenEMR to meet their needs, whether it be done independently with
free community support or with one of many professional OpenEMR vendors.
