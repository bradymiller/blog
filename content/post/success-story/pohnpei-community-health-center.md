Pohnpei Community Health Center (PCHC), a federally funded clinic, was
challenged with the task of going digital with limited internet connectivity.
PCHC needed a customized, easy to use, and scalable system with the goal of
enabling better operational efficiency in terms of handling medical documents
and improved productivity.

With the help of Pacific Island Health Officers Association (PIHOA) and
passionate open source support from Dr. Mark Durand,
[ViSolve](http://hc.visolve.com/) customized OpenEMR for PCHCâ€™s deployment.

PCHC transitioned successfully into a paperless environment, enabling digitized
workflows such as front office registration, dispensing medicine, bill
processing, and checking out patients from the clinic.

ViSolve's on-site training and 24/7 support for PCHC doctors, clinicians, and
front office staff made the migration a smooth and a successful one with a
customized OpenEMR solution.
