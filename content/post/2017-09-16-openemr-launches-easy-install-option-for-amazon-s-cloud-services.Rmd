OpenEMR Cloud, a cloud service version of OpenEMR - the most popular open source electronic health record (EHR) and medical practice management solution, is available in the 5.0.0.4 release of OpenEMR.  OpenEMR has partnered with industry leading Amazon Web Services (AWS) to implement and deliver OpenEMR Cloud to healthcare provider practices and institutions throughout the world. In a few simple steps, healthcare providers can have enjoy the immediate benefits of both OpenEMR and cloud services by deploying OpenEMR Cloud.

Cloud technologies have become a staple in technology and business over the past decade, and the healthcare industry is no exception. As a web platform, OpenEMR makes a seamless transition to the cloud, enabling many benefits including:

#### Automatic Scaling of Computational Resources

Computational resources such as servers, memory, bandwidth, and storage automatically scale based on demand. During peak clinic hours, more computational resources are automatically dedicated to ensure optimal performance of OpenEMR Cloud. During non-peak hours, computational resources are automatically decreased, resulting in minimized costs.

#### Cutting-edge Network Security 

Superior information security, include physical, network, and software security, is designed into OpenEMR and AWS services, offloading significant patient privacy and security demands on healthcare providers. OpenEMR Cloud is fully compliant with HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.

#### Zero On-Site Hardare and Software

OpenEMR Cloud runs hardware and software provided by OpenEMR and Amazon Web Services; no on-site softar, servers & related equipment is required.  

#### Easy Deployment

With only a few simple steps, including specification of OpenEMR's [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/blob/master/fullstack/assets/OpenEMR.json), users can "spin up" their own OpenEMR Cloud instance. Customizations can be tested and deployed with ease.

#### Robust Backup and Recovery Solutions

Automated backups, disaster recovery, and hardware redundancy are automatic in OpenEMR Cloud, fine tuned for clinic and institutional needs.

Before OpenEMR Cloud,  OpenEMR users deployed software on  physical servers or contracted a professional vendor to provide a custom cloud or managed on-site solution. "OpenEMR Cloud provides a modern option for users looking to leverage the cloud on their own terms, with a limited maintenance burden and low cost", says Matthew Vita, an OpenEMR administrator.

"OpenEMR is a natural fit for the cloud", notes Dr. Andre Millet, a Brazilian physician and OpenEMR contributor. "With OpenEMR Cloud, establishing  a hospital EHR is only a few simple steps. We are reducing the distance between clinician and technology, providing tools that diminish repetitive tasks and bureaucratic procedures, allowing more time for poviders to excel at what they does best", says Millet. He believes that lowering the barriers for EHR deployment will encourage more utilization, especially in modern areas of healthcare such as telemedicine, practice analytics and clinical intelligence. During implementation testing, Millet was impressed with the ease of setup and ability to adapt OpenEMR Cloud functionality through source code changes instantly reflected in OpenEMR Cloud instances.

OpenEMR Cloud simplifies OpenEMR management and provides peace of mind. "An on-premise EHR represents unpredictable, front-loaded capital expenditures. Initial server purchase and deployment, on-going warranties, parts replacement, and physical security, are compounded by often-overlooked backup and restore protocols", says Asher Densmore-Lynn, an OpenEMR contributor and cloud architect. The financial benefit of OpenEMR Cloud is significant, transforming capital expenditures into lower equivalent operating expense, enabled by smooth scalability as workloads increase & decrease over time." He adds that clinics and institutions achieve additional operating savings through reduction of in-house expertise in initial systems setup, disaster recovery, and hardware scaling. "All of tasks become more manageable, predictable, and testable with OpenEMR cloud", Densmore-Lynn notes.

OpenEMR is [ONC Certified as a Complete EHR](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/images/0/04/OpenEMR_Complete_EHR_2014_Edition_Cert.pdf) supporting a broad feature set including patient demographics, records, appointments, prescriptions, billing, reports, clinical decision support, and lab integration. For United States customers, OpenEMR Cloud is designed for HIPAA & HITECH compliance. AWS performs the HIPAA Business Associate role for healthcare providers using OpenEMR Cloud. 

"We want to ensure that cost is reasonable and proportional to an institution's EHR utilization", notes Daniel Ehrlich, an OpenEMR contributor and cloud solutions engineer. He notes that lower capital and operating expenses for clinics and institutions are a differentiating feature of OpenEMR Cloud.  

OpenEMR Cloud is developed and maintained by a passionate team within the OpenEMR Community. The Community's choice to partner with industry leading AWS is a testament to AWS's leadership in cloud technology and total cost of ownership of cloud services.
