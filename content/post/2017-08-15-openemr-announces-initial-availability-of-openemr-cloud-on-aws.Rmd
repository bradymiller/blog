OpenEMR Cloud, a cloud service version of OpenEMR - the most popular open source electronic health record (EHR) and medical practice management solution, is available in the 5.0.0.4 release of OpenEMR.  OpenEMR has partnered with industry leading Amazon Web Services (AWS) to implement and deliver OpenEMR Cloud to healthcare provider practices and institutions throughout the world. In a few simple steps, healthcare providers can leverage the benefits of OpenEMR and AWS by deploying OpenEMR Cloud.

Cloud technologies have become a staple in technology and business over the past decade, and the healthcare industry is no exception. As a web platform, OpenEMR makes a seamless transition to the cloud, enabling many benefits including:

#### Automatic Scaling of Computational Resources

Computational resources such as servers, memory, bandwidth, and storage automatically scale based on patient load and provider demand. During peak demand, computational resources are automatically dedicated for optimal delivery of healthcare with OpenEMR Cloud. During non-peak hours, computational resources are automatically relaxed, resulting in minimized costs.

#### Cutting-edge Information Security 

Superior information security, include physical, network, and software security, is designed into OpenEMR and AWS, offloading significant privacy and security demands on healthcare providers. OpenEMR Cloud is fully compliant with HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.

#### Zero On-Site Hardare and Software

OpenEMR Cloud runs hardware and software provided by OpenEMR and Amazon Web Services; no on-site software, servers nor related equipment are required.  

#### Easy Deployment

With only a few simple steps, including specification of OpenEMR's [CloudFormation template](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/blob/master/fullstack/assets/OpenEMR.json), healthcare providers "spin up" their own OpenEMR Cloud instance. Customizations are tested and deployed with ease, with OpenEMR Cloud's continuous deployment model.

#### Robust Backup and Recovery Solutions

Automated backups, disaster recovery, and system redundancy are standard in OpenEMR Cloud, fine tuned for clinic and institutional needs.

Before OpenEMR Cloud,  OpenEMR users deployed software on physical servers or contracted a professional vendor to provide custom cloud or managed on-site solutions. "OpenEMR Cloud provides a modern option for healthcare providers to leverage the cloud on their own terms, with limited maintenance burden and low cost", says Matthew Vita, an OpenEMR administrator.

"OpenEMR is a natural fit for the cloud", notes Dr. Andre Millet, a Brazilian physician and OpenEMR contributor. "With OpenEMR Cloud, establishing a hospital EHR takes only a few simple steps. We are reducing the distance between clinician and technology, providing tools that diminish repetitive tasks and bureaucratic procedures, allowing more time for providers to excel at what they do best", says Millet. He believes lowering barriers for EHR deployment encourages more utilization, especially in modern areas of healthcare such as telemedicine, practice analytics and clinical intelligence. During implementation testing, Millet was impressed with the ease of setup and adaption of OpenEMR functionality through source code changes instantly reflected in OpenEMR Cloud instances.

OpenEMR Cloud simplifies OpenEMR management and provides peace of mind. "An on-premise EHR represents unpredictable, front-loaded capital expenditures. Initial server purchase and deployment, on-going warranties, parts replacement, and physical security, are compounded by often-overlooked backup and restore protocols", says Asher Densmore-Lynn, an OpenEMR contributor and cloud architect. The financial benefit of OpenEMR Cloud is significant, transforming capital expenditures into lower equivalent operating expense. Operating expense is further reduced as computational resources are matched to time-varying workloads." He adds that clinics and institutions achieve additional savings through reduction of in-house expertise in IT architecture, vendor management, systems setup, disaster recovery, and hardware scaling. "All of these tasks become more manageable, predictable, and testable with OpenEMR Cloud", Densmore-Lynn notes.

"We want to ensure that cost is reasonable and proportional to an institution's EHR utilization", notes Daniel Ehrlich, an OpenEMR contributor and cloud solutions engineer. He notes that lower capital and operating expense for clinics and institutions are a differentiating feature of OpenEMR Cloud.  

The OpenEMR Community's choice to partner with industry leading AWS is a testament to AWS leadership in cloud technology and total cost of application ownership.  To get started with OpenEMR Cloud, please visit the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/openemr/openemr-devops/tree/master/fullstack).
