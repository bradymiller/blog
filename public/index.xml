By using a capable open-source, web-based DICOM image viewer, OpenEMR provides clinicians a quick, secure, and robust view into patient images with windowing, panning, zooming, and filtering support. The underlying technology is based on the DICOM Web Viewer (DWV) open-source project led by Yves Martelli, a software engineer and medical imaging expert.</description>
