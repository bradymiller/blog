      <description>Running any successful business can be a difficult task without the right tools and services in place to manage different everyday tasks. Not to mention, the sheer amount of data that must be collected, organized and made accessible when dealing directly with clients or customers. This rings especially true for healthcare and medical practices.
Between the sheer number of clients, billing, scheduling, insurance and medical records, it is critical that a medical practice has their data in order.</description>

      <description>OpenEMR, the most popular open-source electronic health record and medical practice management solution, now offers a full panel of easy to install packages on Amazon’s Cloud Services.
In 2017, OpenEMR released its first Amazon Cloud Services offering, OpenEMR Cloud Full Stack, with the goal of enabling Enterprise use of OpenEMR. However many clinics and academic settings did not require the complexities of a large-scale full cloud offering and/or HIPAA eligibility. The OpenEMR community realized that a one size fits all Amazon cloud service approach could not address the vast range of differing requirements and workflows in modern day clinical and academic settings.</description>

OpenEMR Cloud Standard is the HIPAA-eligible, Marketplace edition of the OpenEMR Cloud product line.</description>

      <title>OpenEMR, A Great Long Term Choice</title>
      <link>https://www.open-emr.org/blog/post/great-long-term-choice/</link>

      <description>Choosing a free and open source EMR with a history of success around the world is a great move for those looking to avoid vendor lock-in. As a mature project with a vibrant community, OpenEMR is a great choice for the long term because the provider owns both the data and the software, and cannot be charged for it &amp;ndash; ever!
Our group has recently noticed an uptick in cost-sensitive clinicians moving from a previously freeware EMR that introduced a new pricing model.</description>

      <description>A team of software engineers within our community recently built the first major medical imaging feature into the system. Given a DICOM file in a patient chart, users can now utilize an easy-to-use medical image visualizer.
By using a capable open-source, web-based DICOM image viewer, OpenEMR provides clinicians a quick, secure, and robust view into patient images with windowing, panning, zooming, and filtering support. The underlying technology is based on the DICOM Web Viewer (DWV) open-source project led by Yves Martelli, a software engineer and medical imaging expert.</description>

      <description>“Developers get so excited over Docker,” said Matthew Vita, a software developer and project administrator for OpenEMR. “By building, testing, and deploying software in Docker containers, no one has to bother with manually installing and configuring complex system dependencies for their operating system. This is a great innovation for OpenEMR developers, testers, and the clinicians we serve.”
OpenEMR, the world’s leading open-source EMR, has offered users various ways to install the platform since its conception in 2002.</description>

      <description>Virginia Commonwealth University&amp;rsquo;s School of Engineering held their second annual HealthHacks event November 3rd and 4th; OpenEMR was not only a sponsor of the event, but also sent me as a representative offering mentorship to the nearly 130 students participating in the event.
When we were approached by VCU to possibly sponsor the event, I immediately recognized the implications this type of event may have for low-resource areas and developing countries.</description>

      <description>Throughout both Hurricane Maria’s initial impact and the rebuilding efforts, Puerto Rico has suffered tremendous infrastructure damage leaving the majority of the islands some 3.4 million people without power, water, communications, and internet access. Despite these challenges, OpenEMR would prove to be vital at multiple healthcare facilities as the island begins the process of rebuilding.
During and immediately following the hurricane’s devastating wind and rain, the following healthcare providers noted OpenEMR as an essential tool in receiving and assisting a large volume of patients:</description>
