        <p>Virginia Commonwealth University&rsquo;s School of Engineering held their second
annual <a href="https://healthhacks.vcu.edu/">HealthHacks</a> event November 3rd and 4th;
OpenEMR was not only a sponsor of the event, but also sent me as a representative
offering mentorship to the nearly 130 students participating in the event.</p>

<p>When we were approached by VCU to possibly sponsor the event, I immediately
recognized the implications this type of event may have for low-resource areas
and developing countries. Over the last few months, various parts of the OpenEMR
community have been working on items from hardware integration to data analytics
to academia; the HealthHacks event was the stepping stone to begin connecting
all of these ideas into well-rounded solutions.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/robert-down-presenting-challenge.jpg" alt="Robert Down Explaining Challenge" /></p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s themes were Global Health and Pediatrics. OpenEMR presented two
challenges to students whose backgrounds include computer science, biology,
electrical engineering, and medicine. Our first challenge was to create an
open-source, low-cost biometric device capable of capturing vital signs (heart
rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and temperature). Currently, clinicians
take vital signs manually, which opens up the opportunity for errors to occur
when transferring information from written notes to the EMR. We wanted a device
capable of capturing this data automatically and sending the results to OpenEMR,
reducing a potential opportunity for data loss or error. This workflow is typical
in the United States and other developed countries, but in developing nations this
workflow offers an place for improvement Our second challenge was to create a
device capable of capturing and monitoring continuous biometric data such as an
EKG (the electrical rhythm of the heart).</p>

<p>Again, we wanted to see this data pushed to a central server for the hospital to
be able to monitor and analyze the data.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/group_dragon.jpg" alt="Team working on deploying OpenEMR on a Dragonboard" /></p>

<p>Throughout the event I was continually in awe of the way these students
approached various problems. I was able to see groups build rapid prototype
solutions aimed at helping children with Autism Spectrum Disorder by using
virtual reality to better acclimate to new environments, build mobile apps that
help children with Type 1 Diabetes, and use predictive modeling to better assess
the risk of sepsis in our pediatric population.</p>

<p>Of all the great things I saw at the event, I think my favorite was seeing people
from different fields of expertise come together to build something. Teams were
competing for prizes, but that didn&rsquo;t stop collaboration between groups. This is
what makes the open-source community vibrant and strong. This is why I love
giving countless hours of my time to the open-source community at large, and
specifically OpenEMR.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/group_sepsis.jpg" alt="Group working on sepsis infection algorithm" /></p>

<p>So did these students meet our challenges? Yes! Several groups took on our
challenges either directly or used it as a base. One group successfully captured
data from an EEG device and provided real-time graph data for Alpha, Beta, and
Delta waves. A second group generated a large sample data group, and used data
analytics and machine learning to attempt to predict early sepsis infections in
pediatric patients. This data is then aggregated and pushed into OpenEMR in a
rolling basis. Additionally, they are able to capture biometric data via sensors.
Given the 24-hour nature of the event, they tackled two problems: first, figure
out how to capture and emit vital sign information; and second, generate some
15,000 rows of sample data (which would otherwise be generated from the
previously mentioned biometric hardware) and run their analysis, pushing the
results into OpenEMR.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/group_watch.jpg" alt="Group working on a watch-type device to measure vital signs" /></p>

<p>A third group began the work of taking biometric-equipped
smartphones and emitting the data from specific health APIs into a server
running on a <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/dragonboard-410c">DragonBoard</a>
and inserting the
data into OpenEMR. This group was able to have a working copy of OpenEMR on the
DragonBoard next to the receiving server. A fourth group used 3D printing to
create a wristband capable of capturing pulse, temperature, blood pressure, and
oxygen saturation. This data can be emitted to OpenEMR or other analytic servers.
The device also contains an LED display for healthcare providers to see the data
in real time, before it makes it to OpenEMR. A fifth group created a similar
device, capturing all four vital sign data points and proceeded to push that
data to a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase server</a>, where analysis would
be run to determine if any data points were outside the normal limits. If the
data was considered abnormal, a push notification would be sent to the physician
for rapid-review.</p>

<p>All-in-all I could not be happier with my time at HealthHacks. I met great people
passionate about open-source and improving patient outcomes worldwide. As the
event wrapped up Sunday afternoon I reminded all the teams I interacted with that
this was not the end, but instead just the beginning of a great adventure. Over
the next few months I fully expect to see these devices continue to be refined
and further enhanced for production use.</p>
